# The Ultimate Superhero Generator

The Ultimate Superhero Generator is a fun little app for finding out what Superhero Power fits a user based on their selection from 3 different attributes.
The app uses Javasript to find the users selected attributes, and then returns a Superhero along with their badge, description, caveats, and nemesis.
